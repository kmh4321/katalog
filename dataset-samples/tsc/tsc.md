## Overview

TensorFlow Speech Command dataset is a set of one-second .wav audio files, each containing a single spoken English word. These words are from a small set of commands, and are spoken by a variety of different speakers. 20 of the words are core words, while 10 words are auxiliary words that could act as tests for algorithms in ignoring speeches that do not contain triggers. Included along with the 30 words is a collection of background noise audio files. The dataset was originally designed for limited vocabulary speech recognition tasks. The audio clips were originally collected by Google, and recorded by volunteers in uncontrolled locations around the world.
