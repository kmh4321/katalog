name: Project CodeNet - MLM subset
description: Project CodeNet is a large-scale dataset with approximately 14 million code samples, each of which is an intended solution to one of 4000 coding problems. This small subset contains 55,000 samples in the C programming language to demonstrate the use of a Masked-Language Model for tokenization tasks.
